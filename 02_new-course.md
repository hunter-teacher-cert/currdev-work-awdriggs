# Digital Art and Web3.0 

## General Description 
I would like to create a digital art and Web3.0 class. It would start with students learning how to code and creating an original generative art using p5.js. Ideally students would create editions that COULD be minted as NFTs. 
Through this, would would explore the computer science concepts that are fundamental to blockchain technologies. We would also explore the non-technical (ethical, environmental, social) concerns surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin, where students would weigh the pros and cons of these emerging platforms. 
Ultimately, students would determine if they would like mint their NFT or not based on their feelings towards these platforms.


## Target Audience
The ideal audience at my school 8th grade students who are interested in art, students who want to code, an students who are curious about NFTs and Crypto. Many of my current students are more technically interested, and my course attracts a lot of gamers and a lot of male identifying students. Turn the focus more towards art, I would like the course to attract a more diverse group of students.

## Continuum of Courses
Currently I'm teaching an 8th grade game design intensive in the fall and a robotics course in the spring. This course could replace the robotics aspect of the course. Alternatively it could fall into the electives options of our school, which happen once a week. This isn't ideal in terms of rigor but could give students a taste of programming if they didn't choose the game design / robotics intensive course.
