# Dream Course
*Prompt: What CS class would you like to develop?*

I would like to create a digital art and Web3.0 class. It would start with students learning how to code and creating an original generative art using p5.js. Ideally students would create editions that COULD be minted as NFTs. 
Through this, would would explore the computer science concepts that are fundamental to blockchain technologies. We would also explore the non-technical (ethical, environmental, social) concerns surrounding Ethereum and Bitcoin, where students would weigh the pros and cons of these emerging platforms. 
Ultimately, students would determine if they would like mint their NFT or not based on their feelings towards these platforms.
