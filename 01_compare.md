# Comparing Two Scratch Game Design Curriculums 
Here I will compare [Google's CS First Game Design Curriculum](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/game-design/overview.html) to my [Scratch Curriculum](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mO6a3sEco2nAisU1W6eKYyhDELPXv3hK?usp=sharing).
 
## Major Differences
The CS First is designed to be self guided where students watch videos and follow along in Scratch. The curriculum I developed relies less on videos and more on code demos and student collaboration. 
I also feel like the complexity of the examples are a little higher in my curriculum then in the CS First examples. For example the platform game example doesn't differentiate between the bottom and top of the platform, so players can jump through a platform. I usually develop a more complex system with the students. This is likely because the wide age range target by the curriculum.
Also few of the CS First game have win lose conditions, this is an important part of many of my projects and allows for a lot of practice with conditional statements.

## Major Similarities 
The are a lot of similarities in common game genres. For example both curriculums have a chase / avoid game. Obviously both use common Scratch patterns. Variables and loops  are a large part of both curriculums. 

## Comparative Strengths and Weaknesses
I believe that my curriculum is less "perscriptive" in the project that students follow. The CS First curriculum is a step by step guide four students to follow. The student guides in my video are more generalized and can be applied in multiple scenarios.

## Adoption
I would be likely to use the projects for students who need a high level of support. I generally let students a lot of latitude in what they choose to design. For struggling students this can be difficult so I usually provide a step by step example for students to follow. These projects would be good for those students and allow them to have more options than just one game.
I also like that offline lessons are provided for times when there are tech issues. I will likely see if there are parts of these lessons that I can use for Unplugged style tasks.
