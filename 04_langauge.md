## Course Description
Game Design is an 8th grade "intensive" course. Students have chosen to take this course. It is an hour long course that meets two times a week. It is highly hands with limited lectures or demos. Students learn by doing.

Students are currently using the block interface of [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/). 

## Language
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) is a very popular block based programming language. Often students are taught to create games using scratch.

## Syntax
The syntax is simple, you can't really make syntax errors because of how the blocks are designing to fit together. Complexity arises as programs grow in scale. It can be hard to navigate and debug large programs.

## Strength
Ease of use is a major strength. There is an extremely low barrier for entry. Students can discover aspects of the programming language on their own after being shown just a few actions. 
It is also engaging. Students are allow to design their own sprites and bring in different media. The visuals are highly customizable. You get immediate visual feedback to see if the code is executing as expected.

I would utilize the strengths by using Scratch to introduce basic patterns such as loops and conditionals. I would use it to engage students who don't think they would ever enjoy coding by giving them opportunities to be creative using scratch and let their personalities come through in their projects. 
I would use scratch for students to create a first game of limited complexity simple win/lose dynamics. Examples would be a chasing game or collecting game.

## Weaknesses
As mentioned before the block interface can become cumbersome as projects grow in complexity. It can be hard to grasp the order of execution or code blocks and you have to add more blocks to debug. It can be annoying to refactor code because you have to do so much pulling apart and putting back together of blocks.
Also, I find that skills developed in Scratch can be difficult for students to generalize into other programming language. For example there is a "repeat until" block that is a while loop. But I find that students to make the connection when taught a while loop in another language. 

As stated before I would have students really scope their projects well to mitigate these weaknesses. I would encourage students to not try and make a platform or RPG game in Scratch as these are so difficult to do. 

## Decision
I would only use Scratch for an introduction to coding with blocks and for the most basic game design projects. I would use Scratch as a "hook" to get students interested in the programming and as a touch point to reference when learning other languages.
For a game design class I much prefer the event driven model of MakeCode Arcade. I also like that you can code in blocks, Javascript, or Python. This allows students to transfer skills to a text based language more easily.
