# Tools

## Microsoft MakeCode Arcade
I use [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) for a Game Design class that I teach for 8th grade students. 

This is a programming environment specifically designed for creating games. It has the option to be block based or scripted using JavaScript or Python.
We use this software to create 2D, arcade style games. The block based interface is very intuitive to use, so I introduce some common moves then let kids jam with it.

I selected this tool for several reasons:
+ It is easy for students to use
+ It allows students to jump between blocks and scripting and is a natural way to move students to text based languages.
+ It makes aspects of game programming that is hard in Scratch much easier.
+ It is events based, so leads into other game coding tools like Unity/Unreal.
+ Games can run on other devices, like a Raspberry PI using RetroPie or a [PyGamer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pygamer?gclid=CjwKCAjwzY2bBhB6EiwAPpUpZmUwsNHv4ZsHiZPJe4EHsfoARrBTOF_7kquBowxpQyf-6Rgq09s7LxoCDaoQAvD_BwE) board.

## LittleBits
I use [LittleBits](https://sphero.com/collections/design-build-systems?gclid=CjwKCAjwzY2bBhB6EiwAPpUpZr-Hodj0p6PcbQbXF2FUSUtYOHuAKo_tKV1Kz0JKoBD2VoCEg0NLHxoCW_gQAvD_BwE) in a technology/making class for 7th grade students.

LittleBits are tiny circuit blocks that can be snapped together in different ways. They are blocks for output; motors, fans, lights, and speakers. There are blocks for inputs; dials, sliders, and buttons. Also, there different logic blocks like an if, else, xor and splits.
Students solve engineering and tinkering tasks with the LittleBits. There are also arduino blocks that you can program using a block based interface.

I selected this tool for several reasons:
+ They are super fun, intuitive, and foster curiosity.
+ With a lower barrier for entry, kids who don't think of themselves as "techies" still love these!
+ Great way to learn about circuits and electronics without shocking yourself or making things spark.
